^008040Ingredients to make a cocktail, Wug Blood : ^ff0000Melange Pot 1 / 3 Bloods of wolf, 2 Cold Ices ^000000

~ This is the cocktail that came in mind when I was traveling around the north. Hot weather and no water...
Honeslty, I wanted to drink the waste but with the cook's pride, I did not do it.
I tried to find mukas aroudn there but could not see its spits. In despair,
I went to the ice dungeon and met a herd of wolves. They were so many. I had no choice
so fleed into the ice dungeon.. Some of them followed me. (omitted)... 
There was no problem until guards found me, who bathed with blood and ice
(omitted)... At last I looked like a vampire! How did I look like a vampire

even jellopies. Then some nice flavor led me from somewhere so I followed it and found! 
What on earth! Someone boiled something in a pot! I ate it greedily and then felt someone behind me
No, some cow? Perhaps, I might be boiled in the pot... Ah! Now
We are talking about cooking... I told you that we had to remove the horns first...!  (omitted)

^008040Ingreidents to make Drocera Herb Stem : ^ff00001 Melange Pot / 3 Drocera Tentacles, 3 Red Herbs, 3 Blue Herbs, 3 White Herbs, 
                                1 Large Cookpot ^000000

~ I believe that this is the best for those who do not like green vegetables. Several herbs
are mixed to show all kinds of natural colors! When you eat it, it is fresh and fantastically chewed.
Chewing only vevetables makes their jaws tired so that they cannot
eat a lot. But, together with soft taste of drocera, you can feel the fantastic chew of it.
Actually I wanted to add some more spices, but to keep the scent of herbs, I didn't use other materials
as much as I can. Shake up up down down left right left right ABAB BABA....(omitted)


~ It is really amaging that nobody tried to eat the tail of Petti. This is one of the delicacy especially in summer.
The water in this soup is from the clear (Beep - )... town.
Oops, I told a secrete of the company¡¦ Please do not expose the name of the town that I talked.
Anyway, this noodle is also made of organic farmed flour.
You can add the great taste of nature by using only these fresh and clean ingredients 
though you didn't use any spice. Soup of Petti's tail makes the flavour more deep and rich. So
you need to put it in the melting pot and mature it at least one day to get better taste...(Omitted)
