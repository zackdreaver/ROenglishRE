^000088Alchemy Basics: Alcohol Creation^000000


----------------Preface--------------------

The entire alchemy world is panicking, even as I write
this. Hundreds of Alchemists, despairing of their studies,
have produced copious amounts of alcohol using the method
that was announced by the Scholar Association. None of us
expected this disaster to happen, but more and more Alchemists
are abusing this alcohol production method. I hope you, fair reader,
never succumb to the ills of alcohol once you decide to learn alchemy.
I leave this you this book, hoping that it will prevent future Alchemists
from harming themselves with the knowledge they learn.

"Alcoholism... It's no good!"

What is^ff0000alcohol^000000?

In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound
in which a hydroxyl group (-OH) is bound to a carbon
atom of an alkyl or substituted alkyl group.

The general formula is ROH. Methanol is formed when
an alkyl group bonds to a methyl group, a hydrophobic alkyl
group derived from ethane. Ethanol is formed when an alkyl
group bonds to an ethyl group, an alkyl functional group derived
from ethane. The structure of an alkyl is the same as its straight
chained hydrocarbon counterpart but with one less hydrogen atom.
