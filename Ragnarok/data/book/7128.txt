^000088Alchemy Basics: Bottle Grenade Creation^000000


----------------Preface--------------------

The book detailing the alcohol production
process was used by the public in several
ways after they gained access to it. The
military incorporated the alcohol production
process to develop the Bottle Grenade
production process which is detailed in
this book. Bottle Grenades were developed
for the military: this information is considered
highly dangerous, so please do not release this
book to the public for the sake of preventing
disasters similar to the alcohol fiasco.

What is a ^0000ffBottle Grenade^000000?

In its simplest form, a Bottle Grenade
is a glass bottle that contains gasoline.



Ingredients: ^4b00821 Alcohol, 1 Fabric, 1 Empty Bottle^000000

Directions: 
Carefully pour alcohol into a medicine bowl, and
expose it in the air to oxidize it. Fill an empty
bottle with the oxidized alcohol, and stick the fabric
into the bottle so that half of it is soaking the alcohol,
and the other half is sticking out of the bottle. Tie a knot
in the fabric near the bottle opening to ensure that the
alcohol won't spill. Keep this book with you and refer
to it while you gather the ingredients and use the Prepare
Potion skill so that you can create Bottle Grenades.
