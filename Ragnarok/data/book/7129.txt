^000088Alchemy Basics: Acid Bottle Creation^000000


----------------Preface--------------------

We learned that we could produce hydrogen
Chloride under certain conditions in our experimentation
with immortal hearts. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acidic
Solution with a high degree of ionization: it is so acidic that
it can smelt rock, and must be handled with the appropriate
safety precautions. This book details the production process
of hydrochloric acid for use in Acid Bottles.

What is ^008040hydrochloric acid^000000?

Hydrochloric acid is the aqueous solution of
Hydrogen chloride gas (HCl). Acid bottles used
in combat are usually filled with hydrochloric acid.

Ingredients: ^4b00821 Immortal Heart, 1 Empty Bottle^000000

Directions: Place an immortal heart in a medicine
bowl, and add water. Warm the bowl using a double boiler,
keeping the water temperature at 72 degrees. Collect the gas
from the bowl, and distill it to produce hydrogen chloride.
Fill an empty bottle with water and combine it with the hydrogen
chloride to form the acid. Keep this book with you and refer
to it while you gather the ingredients and use the Prepare
Potion skill so that you can create Acid Bottles.
