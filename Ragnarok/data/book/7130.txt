^000088Alchemy Basics: Plant Bottle Creation^000000


----------------Preface--------------------
Using alchemy to shape and mold biological forms
is very difficult, and considered very advanced science.
When we conducted form changing experiments on plants,
we failed to transform any of them since they were too weak
to survive any alchemic changes. Just before we decided to
abandon this research, we discovered that the man-eating
plants near Mount Mjolnir and Juno are incredibly hardy,
and can endure alchemic transformation. This book details
the process of transforming man-eating plants into bottle form.

What is a ^ff8040plant bottle^000000?

Plant bottles are alchemically treated man-eating
plants that have been transformed so that they can be
carried in bottles. Throwing this bottle in the ground will
produce a fully grown Plant monster that will attack other
creatures. Alchemists must have the Summon Flora skill in
order to transform the plant bottles into man-eating plants.
