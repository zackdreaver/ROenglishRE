^000088Basic Alchemy: Marine Sphere Creation^000000


----------------Preface--------------------
We discovered a monster called Marine Sphere
while exploring Izlude. It floated peacefully in the
water, but exploded if something came into contact
with it. We devised a way so that it could survive
outside of water and move in the air, and developed
a method so that it could be alchemically converted
into a bottled form. We think using Marine Spheres
as bombs would be useful for Alchemists to defend
themselves against hostile enemies.

What is a ^400080marine sphere^000000?

Marine Spheres are living bombs that explode
if something touches it. They can be transformed
into a bottled form that must be handled with the
appropriate safety precautions. Alchemists must
also learn the Summon Marine Sphere skill to
transform bottled Marine Spheres back into
their original forms.

Ingredients: ^4b00821 Detonator, 1 Tendon, 1 Empty Bottle^000000

Directions: Place the detonator and tendon into
a medicine bowl, and use the Prepare Potion skill
while referring to this book. You must learn the
Summon Marine Sphere skill if you want to
Produce a live Marine Sphere from the bottle.
