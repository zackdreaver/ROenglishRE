^000088Produce special potions to enhance
resistance to elemental properties.^000000


----------------Preface--------------------
You can temporarily increase resistance to the
four basic elements, Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth
properties, by using catalyzers to produce potions
that will provide protection for each element. I write
this book on property resistance with the wish that
my principles and knowledge of the four basic
elements will help future Alchemists.

What is a ^ff0000property resistance potion^000000?


Property resistance potions temporarily increase
resistance to one element, but also reduce resistance
to that element's opposing element. For example, fireproof
potions can reduce damage from the Fire property, but they
also increase damage from the Water property.
